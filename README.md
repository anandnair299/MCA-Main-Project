Automated Pay And Park Syatem Using Computer Vision

Technologies used: 

OpenCV

Tesseract OCR

React.js

Django

The Project aims at utilizing Computer Vision with OpenCV for Vehicle License Plate Detection and Tesseract OCR for reading the characters on the license plate.

OpenCV detects license plate form an input image and Tesseract OCR reads the characters on the license plate.

The license plate number is stored along with timestamp and date in an SQLite database.

The Project eliminates the generation of tickets while parking and reduces paper waste, increases efficiency and creates a user friendly experience for the people utilizing the parking facility.

The bill calculation is completely automated and thus eliminates the chance of human error.
